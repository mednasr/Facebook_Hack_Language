======= check for even/odd integer values by inspecting the low-order bit ========
-5 is odd
-4 is even
-3 is odd
-2 is even
-1 is odd
0 is even
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
4 is even
5 is odd
Lowercase equivalent of 'A' is 'a'
Uppercase equivalent of 's' is 'S'
======= swap two integers ========
$v1 = 1234, $v2 = -987
$v1 = -987, $v2 = 1234
======= misc stuff ========
0b101101 & 0b111 = 0b101
0b101101 | 0b111 = 0b101111
0b101101 ^ 0b111 = 0b101010
======= Test all kinds of scalar values to see which are ints or can be implicitly converted ========
-3 & 123 = int(121)
-3 | 123 = int(-1)
-3 ^ 123 = int(-122)
0 & 123 = int(0)
0 | 123 = int(123)
0 ^ 123 = int(123)
1000 & 123 = int(104)
1000 | 123 = int(1019)
1000 ^ 123 = int(915)
