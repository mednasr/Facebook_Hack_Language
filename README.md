# Hack Language Specification

This repo contains the Hack Language Specification and some tutorials made by me.

The easiest way to navigate the specification is
via the [table of contents](https://github.com/mednasr/Hack_Language_Beginners_Tutorial/Spec/00-specification-for-hack.md).


You can run the specification tests with **HHVM** via its
test runner and the
**Hack typechecker** via `hh_client`.
